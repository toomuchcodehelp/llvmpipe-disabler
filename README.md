# llvmpipe-disabler

A neat little script i wrote to disable llvmpipe for my linux machines.
it has nearly zero effort, and mainly is here for me to reuse easily via wget.

## the problem
the reason i made this is because LLVM-PIPE keeps running, basically ruining all my vulkan games, especially ALVR.
don't use this if you actually use llvm, itll break it.
